   * **People Analytics:**
      * Speakers: [Ben Attxix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benattix/) and [Andrew Garfinkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-garfinkel-8b820898/)
      * Detail: People Analytics uses techniques (ranging from descriptive statistics to predictive analytics to experimental research) to help organizations uncover new insights, solve people problems, and direct actions. There are many business drivers and use cases for why a company would want to use people analytics, but there are also ethical considerations to take into account when using people's data. In this presentation, we will deep dive into the use case of employee attrition, explaining the business impact, data architecture to support the analysis, sample dashboards to analyze results, and lessons learned from implementation.
   * **How will know we are in Recovery?**
      * Speaker: [Michael Boldin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-boldin-b1903874/)
      * Detail: This talk will present my experience and impressions from merging data science principles with conventional economic research and forecasting. In particular, I will survey the varying quality and timeliness of national and regional economic indicators and discuss data and modeling issues that limit the accuracy of economic forecasts. The current situation, where wide-spread and sudden shutdowns from the outbreak of the corona virus have pushed the economy into a depression-like decline, suggests that regional data and regional-oriented models are likely to provide the best indicators of an economic recoveries. One goal of this presentation is to encourage anyone who is interested in the topic to apply creativity thinking to a timely issue that combines problems in data management and modeling that are far-from-solved by the economics profession.
